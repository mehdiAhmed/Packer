#Packer Examples
The templates in this repo are meant to be an introduction to new users of 
Packer. They provide configuration examples for stripped-down vms, and should
work out of the box assuming the user has properly installed packer and any 
necessary software.

The focus of this repository is to provide useful real-world examples of all the
core Packer builders, processors, and post-processors that are supported by 
Hashicorp.
